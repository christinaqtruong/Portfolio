# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio, where you can see my recent project and current jams. 

#About Me
Hi! My name is Christina Truong, and I am an aspiring full-stack developer based in Austin, Texas. I graduated with two degrees in Medical Laboratory Science (B.S) and Microbiology (B.S) from the University of Texas (2017) and worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) for two years in a hospital. I am currently studying Web Development through UT's full-time summer Boot Camp while doing projects you can find on my portfolio. I hope to transition from the medical field into the world of computer science as a web developer and to eventually complete a Masters in Computer Science and work in a field where I can develop and improve medical software.
