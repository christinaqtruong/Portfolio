My personal portfolio I built from scratch. Features a JavaScript client that dynamically populates project details when the corresponding icon is selected. The carousel is built using Bootstrap populated by looping through an array of icons. Gifs demonstrating the project were created using ezgif.com and screenshots, and page navigation is done using reference links. The carousel previous/next svgs are credited to: https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons
