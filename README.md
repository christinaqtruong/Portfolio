A website designed from scratch using vanilla html, [flaticon](flaticon.com), [bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) and [sass]([sass-lang.com]) to showcase the first projects I created as a developer back in 2019 as part of the University of Texas at Austin's Coding Boot Camp summer cohort. The deployed version can be found at [here]([https://christinaqtruong.github.io/](https://christinaqtruong.github.io/))).

  

## Getting Started

  

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

  


### Prerequisites

  

This application requires that you have Node and yarn/npm installed on your machine.

-  [Node.js]([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/))


### Setting Up

You can install the [yarn]([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)) package manager and the following command to install the required dependencies

```
npm install -g yarn

yarn install
```

  

or you can also use run the following [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) command:

```
npm install
```

To push the application to github, use:

````
git init

git remote add origin repository_URL
````

  

The *repository_URL* is the link you would use to clone down your github repository.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to github pages, navigate to the **Settings** page of the repository and set the "Source" to *gh-pages*.
