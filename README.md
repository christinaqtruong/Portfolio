# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio, where you can see my recent projects and learn a little bit about me. 

#About Me
Hi! My name is Christina Truong, and I am an aspiring full-stack developer based in Austin, Texas. I graduated with two degrees: Medical Laboratory Science (B.S) and Microbiology (B.S) from the University of Texas (2017) and worked as a hospital Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) for two years. I recently completed the Web Development program at UT's full-time summer Boot Camp and am currently taking online courses and working on projects to improve my skills. I hope to transition from the medical field into the world of computer science as a web developer and eventually complete a Masters in Computer Science.
